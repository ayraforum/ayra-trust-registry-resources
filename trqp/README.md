# TRQP Alignment


## Issues to Raise

- **Missing metadata endpoint:** the TRQP does not have an explicit `/metadata` endpoint. Metadata is hard - it is rarely ever consistent in the beholder's eye. For now, Ayra is focused on using the Ayra Profile (Swagger/etc.) to define what Ayra's metadata needs are.
  - **Compensating Measure:** We have the `/metadata` endpoing in the Ayra Profile
  - **FUTURE:** Raise issue post Public Review about such and endpoint
